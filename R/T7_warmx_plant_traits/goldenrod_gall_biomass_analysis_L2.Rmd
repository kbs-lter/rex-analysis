Data Exploration
```{r}
# The first thing we do is check the distribution of the raw data
# We're checking for a normal distribution; the distribution of the raw data
# doesn't matter as much as the distribution of a model's residuals (which we'll also check),
# but its a good way to get a glimpse of how the data look
descdist(biomass$Biomass, discrete = FALSE) # checks what type of distribution your data matches
hist(biomass$Biomass) # should be a bell curve if normal
qqnorm(biomass$Biomass) # should be a straight diagonal line if normal
shapiro.test(biomass$Biomass) # p > 0.05 if normal
# making a model to test distribution of model residuals
raw.data.test <- lm(Biomass ~ Climate_Treatment * Galling_Status, data=biomass) # testing model
hist(resid(raw.data.test)) # checking model residuals
shapiro.test(resid(raw.data.test))
# looks pretty good, going to try some transformations but might not need them

# log normal transformation
biomass$log_biomass <- log(biomass$Biomass)
descdist(biomass$log_biomass, discrete = FALSE)
hist(biomass$log_biomass)
qqnorm(biomass$log_biomass)
shapiro.test(biomass$log_biomass) # looks good
# making a model to test distribution of model residuals w/ log transformation
raw.data.test.log <- lm(log_biomass ~ Climate_Treatment * Galling_Status, data=biomass) # testing model
hist(resid(raw.data.test.log)) # checking model residuals
shapiro.test(resid(raw.data.test.log))
# better - going with log transformation

# square root transformation
biomass$sqrt_biomass <- sqrt(biomass$Biomass)
descdist(biomass$sqrt_biomass, discrete = FALSE)
hist(biomass$sqrt_biomass)
qqnorm(biomass$sqrt_biomass)
shapiro.test(biomass$sqrt_biomass) # looks good
# making a model to test distribution of model residuals w/ sqrt transformation
raw.data.test.sqrt <- lm(sqrt_biomass ~ Climate_Treatment * Galling_Status, data=biomass) # testing model
hist(resid(raw.data.test.sqrt)) # checking model residuals
shapiro.test(resid(raw.data.test.sqrt))

# going wiht log transformation
```

Assumption checking
```{r}
# in the assumption checking, we're making sure that our full model meets the assumptions of the model.
# the model below is the model structure we can use for all response variables; its testing to see
# if there is 1. an effect of climate treatment on height, 2. an effect of galling status on height, and 3. does the
# effect of climate on height depend on galling status. Subplot nested within footprint nested within rep is used as our # random effect to account for variation between plots. Year is also included as a random effect to account for variation # between years.
m1 <- lmer(log_biomass ~ Climate_Treatment * Galling_Status + (1|Rep/Footprint/Subplot) + (1|Year), data = biomass, REML=F)
# Check Assumptions:
# (1) Linearity: if covariates are not categorical
# (2) Homogeneity: Need to Check by plotting residuals vs predicted values.
plot(m1, main = "Soca Biomass")
# Homogeneity of variance looks a bit off (increasing variance in resids does increase with fitted values)
# Check for homogeneity of variances (true if p>0.05). If the result is not significant, the assumption of equal variances (homoscedasticity) is met (no significant difference between the group variances).
leveneTest(residuals(m1) ~ biomass$Climate_Treatment) # met
leveneTest(residuals(m1) ~ biomass$Galling_Status) # met
# (3) Normality of error term: need to check by histogram, QQplot of residuals, could do Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
# Check for normal residuals
qqPlot(resid(m1), main = "Soca biomass")
hist(residuals(m1), main = "Soca biomass")
shapiro.test(resid(m1))
outlierTest(m1) # checking for outliers - none
```

Checking model results
```{r}
summary(m1)
anova(m1)
# therefore, we need to check the pairwise comparisons of all treatments with a post-hoc test
contrast(emmeans(m1, ~Climate_Treatment*Galling_Status), "pairwise", simple = "each", combine = F, adjust = "mvt")
emmip(m1, Climate_Treatment~Galling_Status)
```
